In order to register the GetServerCert native application, so the browser will find it, open the PowerShell prompt and change directory to where you put the .exe file, then give the following command:
```pwsh
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup_native_host.ps1
```
Do not worry: that script is _absolutely_ harmless.
