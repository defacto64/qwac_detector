Once you download the GetServerCert executable, it will almost certainly not run until you grant it permission.
If you see a warning dialog like the folllowing, it indicates that **GateKeeper** has intervened to protect you from malware (which is good):

![macos_warning1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a23bac3-6a49-4634-91b4-a3032a4d80be)

This is a **false positive**, however!

To fix this hassle, you need to explicitly allow GetServerCert to run as shown in the following screenshot (just click on `Allow Anyway`):

Afterwards, if you still see a warning that "**macOS cannot verify the developer...**" just click on `Open` and it should not come back again.
