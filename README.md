# QWAC Detector
An experimental WebExtension to detect, validate, and display QWACs (Qualified Website Authentication Certificates) according to Approach #1 of ETSI TS 119 411-5.

âš **This is NOT production-grade software!**

I developed this WebExtension in (some of) my spare time, __just for fun__.

This software is NOT bug-free, is NOT supported, and is NOT optimized. It may NOT always be accurate or reliable. I did NOT care about privacy issues. I did NOT follow any software engineering methodology. This software may cause your browser to become unresponsive or to crash. If you decide to use it, or just give it a try, you do it AT YOUR OWN RISK.

To date, this WebExtension only works with Chromium-based browsers. I also developed a similar add-on for Firefox, but for now I am not sharing it.

## Specifications
* Retrieve the web server's TLS certificate (only for the main frame).
* Parse the certificate and extract some basic information from it.
* Check if the certificate is a QWAC (based on QcStatements).
* Lookup certificate into the EU Trust Services Lists.
* Check if the issuing CA is an active QTSP enabled for QWACs.
* Make QWAC information available to the popup window.
* Enable the clickable EU Trust Mark icon in the toolbar.
